Repository has code to demostrate the working of Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP) using Spring Boot Framework.

## Dependency Injection
  In the code we can find the Engine Bean injected into the car class.
  
  Annotations @Component and @Autowired are used for the injection of the bean into the class.
  
## Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP)
  Helper class acts as the the Aspect class
  Methods "startLog()", "endLog()", "indicatorOn()". "indicatorOff()" acts as the Advices in the AOP.
